## General information
This repository includes two separate applications - Gomoku and Paint - that use the same Library. The library is used for common features like manipulating the console size/colour/etc and error handling.

Gomoku is a two player application based on an abstract strategy board game also called Five in a Row. It features a 15x15 board where users can place different coloured game pieces. The application keeps track of the players names, game moves, longest runs and pieces in play. It also allows the players to undo game moves, and completely restart a game.

Paint is an application that is a simple version of Microsoft's Paint. There is access to 6 different colours to create digital art with.
